# Solana Airdrop Faucet

This repository provides a simple Solana Airdrop Faucet for testing on the Solana devnet. The faucet allows users to request a small amount of SOL (Solana cryptocurrency) to their wallets. The faucet utilizes the `@solana/web3.js` library for interacting with the Solana blockchain and is built using React.
